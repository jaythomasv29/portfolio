    "bio": "Hi there! I am James! I've been coding for over 4 years now. As a Full Stack developer I've worked as an intern as a web developer at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, and with a large corporation as a Software Developer to help build custom APIs and applications using a wide variety of technologies. My current tech stack consists of React, Javascript, MongoDB, and NodeJS, but I dabble in Python and Angular from time-to-time. I have a wide-breadth of experience in the restaurant industry, and in the automotive sales industry. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in building user interfaces and connecting them to the back end. I get excited jumping into development and accomplishing a plan. I enjoy testing my results and constantly improving my work and owning my features to make them the best they can possibly be. With that being said, welcome to my website! I hope you can learn about me as your browse.",
